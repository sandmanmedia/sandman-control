<h1>Sandman Control</h1>

<h3>MissionControl Admin Template update for Joomla 3.x</h3>
<hr>
<p>We have been waiting for a an update from the team at <a href="http://www.rockettheme.com/joomla/templates/">Rocket Theme</a> to make an update for the sought-after <a href="http://www.rockettheme.com/joomla/templates?task=download.download&id=399&downloadid=e6b0cf8d">Mission Control</a> Admin Theme.</p>

<p>Since MissionControl development has been abandoned by RocketTheme we took it on ourselves to develop a working theme that replicates it.</p>

<p>Inside is an installable version of Sandman Control, we are looking for your help to keep the project alive.</p>

##  Customizations
###   Adding a Custom Css File

<p>You can add custom styles in a .css file by either adding the file "custom.css" to the css folder of this template or you can add a "custom.less" file to the less folder and compiling from the admin area.</p>
<p>The backend files have been modified to look for this file and load it if it exists.</p>
